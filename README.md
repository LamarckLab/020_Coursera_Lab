# 基于梯度下降算法的线性回归

## Gradient descent summary
So far in this course, you have developed a linear model that predicts $f_{w,b}(x^{(i)})$:
$$f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) = wx^{(i)} + b \tag{1}$$
In linear regression, you utilize input training data to fit the parameters $w$,$b$ by minimizing a measure of the error between our predictions $f_{w,b}(x^{(i)})$ and the actual data $y^{(i)}$. The measure is called the $cost$, $J(w,b)$. In training you measure the cost over all of our training samples $x^{(i)},y^{(i)}$
$$J(w,b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{m-1} (f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2\tag{2}$$
